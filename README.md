## This repository is a fork from - https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts;

We did some changes to make it easier to run **service-jee-jaxrs** and **app-jee-html5** applications on **Openshift** without needing to spend much time configuring Keycloak adapter on Wildfly / JBoss application server;

**YOU CAN USE THIS REPOSITORY TO DEPLOY KEYCLOAK APPLICATIONS ON OPENSHIFT IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME DEMONSTRATIONS AND SEE HOW THE PRODUCT CAN PROTECT YOU APPLICATIONS**
